## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### 🚨 BREAKING changes: Configuration Schema changes

Hedwig will fail to start without adjustment to your configuration!

Most existing configuration settings have been renamed(if you had a setting that started with `fcm_`, you will have to make a change). Specific settings for Android(FCM) and iOS(FCM or APNS) have been added. New optional telemetry settings have been added.

Previously, Hedwig configuration was fairly simple. The new changes are extensive, and it is recommended you start from a fresh configuration file based on the provided sample config yaml. Copying existing settings to this new file should be fairly straight forward.

The FCM (google) auth has also changed, you either need to set the config var `fcm_credentials_file_path` pointing to your existing credentials file, or use one of the methods listed [here](https://github.com/djc/gcp_auth/blob/5a1e48db47784c9afdbad38a33907cb2e98bbfdd/README.md).

Support for direct APNS is optional, config related to it isn't mandatory.

### 🚀 Features

- add support for most fcm and apns notification keys and headers
- add direct APNS support
